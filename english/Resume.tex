\section* {Work Experience}

\begin{description}
  \item[Software Engineer Intern at Facebook Inc.] {\hfill January - April 2016\\
  Worked in the Video Encoding Team, on video stabilization algorithms. Researched various methods to understand when stabilization is necessary or not and saving computing time when it is not needed. This unnecessary processing can be very prejudicial since they can deform the video and lower its quality.

Uniformed the formats of all videos on the site, which varied along the company's development. This had various unwanted consequences on
the system, which I reverted during the internship.
}

  \item[Software Engineer Intern at Facebook Inc.] {\hfill January - April 2015\\
Worked in the Public Content Ranking Team, developing algorithms to improve the quality of recommendations on videos and articles shown in newsfeed. These recommendations are other videos related to the original one and are shown to the user when he or she starts watching a video.
}

  \item[Teacher Assistant at University of Buenos Aires] {\hfill March 2014 - ongoing\\
  Responsible for assisting students with their inquiries (involving class projects and 
  exercises) and grading exams and projects. Currently teaching in Algorithms 
  and Data Structures III.\\
}
\item[Coach for Mathematics Olympiads in:]
\item[\tabu Argentine Model School (EAM)] {\hfill March 2013 - October 2016}
\item[\tabu Martin Buber School] {\hfill March - December 2013}
\item[\tabu Superior School in Commerce ``Carlos Pellegrini'' (ESCCP)] { \hfill March - December 2012 \\
Helped students acquire problem solving techniques and mathematical concepts necessary in Mathematics Olympiads, and stimulated them to continue researching and solving problems on their own.
